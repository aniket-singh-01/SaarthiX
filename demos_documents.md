# How We Made the Demos

## 1. üé¨ Agentic Video Editing
Ever dreamed of creating stunning video edits that captivate your audience? With Agentic-AIGC, you can transform your favorite video clips into breathtaking montages that tell your unique story, complete with perfectly synchronized music and transitions.

In **video production and editing**, finding visual information is crucial, as it allows for better alignment with music, audio, or text. Agentic-AIGC extracts useful visual information from videos, and here we use VideoRAG to index and caption videos of unlimited length. You can configure your settings in `videoragcontent.py`

```
class VideoRAG:
    working_dir: str = field(
        default_factory=lambda: f"./videorag_cache_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S')}"
    )

    # video
    threads_for_split: int = 10
    video_segment_length: int = 30 # 30 seconds
    rough_num_frames_per_segment: int = 10 # 5 frames
```
Creating videos with Agentic-AIGC requires aligning with the user's ideas, which is a key step. First, the user inputs a query about their video idea, and Agentic-AIGC performs a more granular query decomposition of the user's idea. This results in several sub-queries, each of which can match a video clip in the material library, enabling video creation. When using the Movie Editing feature, the storyboard agent `story_editor.py` percept the available visual material, allowing for more precise generation and utilization of each sub-query.

In the final stage of video production, the duration of each shot may vary. The video editor agent `vid_editor.py` performs fine-grained visual editing based on each retrieved video segment by comparing the video content with the corresponding sub-queries. It selects the moments that best match the visual content with the lowest redundancy for use.

### 1.1 Agentic Movie Edits

üöÄ **Technical Details**
- Users just need to prepare the video sources, music audio file and the idea they want.
- Automatically extract music rhythm points (optional) setting threshold & mask parameters.
- Automatically assists with storyboard query design through video content based on user-provided ideas.
- Automatically complete the editing and integration of the video.

In beat-synced video editing, cuts and transitions align with the music's rhythm. We also enhance the narrative through visual storytelling by featuring high-energy visuals during musical climaxes.
In the beat synchronization module, we load .mp3 audio files using librosa and calculate RMS (Root Mean Square) energy to identify rhythmic patterns. The system finds rhythm points by detecting peaks in the energy signal above a configurable threshold, with options to filter out points that are too close together temporally (since viewers may not prefer excessive transitions at the beginning of a video). The video transition times and spectrogram with detected rhythm points are sent to `story_editor.py`, enabling the agent to determine which transitions require high-energy frames.
You can configure your preferences in`music_filter.py`:
```
# Define mask ranges - times in seconds where you don't want to detect rhythm points
mask_ranges = [(0, 5)]

# Detect rhythm points
rhythm_data = agent.detect_rhythm_points(
    energy_threshold=0.4,
    min_interval=3.0,
    smoothing_window=5,
    mask_ranges=mask_ranges
    )
```

## 2. Agentic Video Remaking
Want to create engaging and hilarious meme videos? Agentic-AIGC helps you craft memorable content by intelligently combining video clips, text, and effects into shareable content that could go viral.

### 2.1 üé® Agentic Meme Video

üöÄ **Technical Details**
- Users just need to provide the video path and your requirements.
- Automatically preprocesses audio (voice separation, loudness normalization, resampling, transcription) with corresponding agents
- Automatically segments the audio and performs segment-level copywriting adaptation via the Writer Agent
- Uses the Infer Agent for zero-shot inference on audio segments
- Aligns and merges audio-visual content automatically with the Combiner Agent

üåü **Key Features:**
- Intelligent understanding and transformation of meme concepts
- Precise audio synthesis and precise scene matching

For the production of Meme Videos, we first extract the audio portion from the video (`mad_tts.py`), then segment it according to specific rules (`mad_tts_slicer.py`) and transcribe it (`transcriber.py`). Next, we use LLM to rewrite the content of the audio segments based on user requirements (`mad_tts_writer.py`), and employ the open-source audio inference tool Fish-Speech to generate audio according to the rewritten script (`mad_tts_infer.py`). Finally, we dynamically adjust the duration of the corresponding segments in the original video based on the generated audio segment lengths and merge the adjusted video segments (`mad_tts_combiner.py`).

The Â∞èÊòéÂâëÈ≠î meme has gained massive popularity recently through his insightful yet comedic streaming commentary. Many content creators have successfully adapted his distinctive speech pattern into creative videos. We've used Agentic-AIGC to generate three videos of this viral meme format, each capturing the unique style and energy of the original while adding new creative elements.

üìù **Prompts**:
```
Video 1:
Background: Mixue Ice Cream is a national chain brand focusing on ice cream and tea beverages. On March 15th (Consumer Rights Day), they were reported to be using overnight lemons. However, compared to other exposures, using overnight lemons isn't considered a particularly serious violation and is somewhat understandable.

- Speaker: Snow King (Mixue's representative)
- Purpose: Emphasize that the **overnight lemon** situation isn't too serious, highlighting Mixue's good reputation
- Must preserve the phrases "Look in my eyes tell me why why baby why", "ÂõûÁ≠îÊàë"
- Must end with the word "ËØ¥ËØù"
- If the original text contains awkward phrasing, such as redundant words or confused semantics, don't imitate that style or sentence structure
- Ensure natural and fluent sentences
```
```
Video 2:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang (me):
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang (me)
- Start with "**Âåó‰ºêÂ§±Ë¥•ÊÄé‰πà‰∏çÊâæÊâæËá™Â∑±ÈóÆÈ¢ò**" (Why don't you look at your own problems for the failure of the Northern Expedition), followed by "...ÊâæËá™Â∑±ÈóÆÈ¢ò" pattern sentences that **all** reference anime events
- Anime examples must mention specific characters
- Only the **last** "...ÊâæËá™Â∑±ÈóÆÈ¢ò" should return to the Northern Expedition scenario
- Use colloquial language and diverse anime references
```
```
Video 3:
Based on the following scenario, create an angry rebuttal from Zhuge Liang (me):
- Speaker: Zhuge Liang (me)
- Zhuge Liang (me) is challenged about why a certain Three Kingdoms character has a higher rating than him and launches a fierce rebuttal
- Must include: "‰∏âÁÇπÈõ∂„ÄÅÂçÅ‰∏âÁÇπÈõ∂„ÄÅË∫∫Ëµ¢Áãó"
- Do not start with "Èõ∂Êù†Âá†"
- Later rating comparisons should show stark differences (can be exaggerated)
- Use colloquial language, align with historical facts, and only replace specific content
```

### 2.2 Agentic Music Videos
Ready to create music videos realizing your creative ideas? Agentic-AIGC helps you write lyrics, select singers you specify, and generate matching visuals to bring your musical vision to life. The system can coordinate lyrics, visuals, and music to create engaging amateur music videos.

üöÄ **Technical Details**
- Users just need to provide the music MIDI file, original lyrics, BGM file (optional), target voice file, and requirements.
- Automatically performs loudness normalization and annotates the MIDI file using the Annotator Agent.
- Automatically calibrates and adapts lyrics at the word level via the Analyzer Agent.
- Automatically divides long rest intervals to reduce melodic errors and enables song covers.

üåü **Key Features:**
- Automated lyric generation based on themes
- Intelligent matching of visuals and lyrics

For music video production, we first extract melodic information from MIDI files (`analyzer.py` and `annotator.py`). To achieve high-quality rhythmic impact, we use the open-source music generation tool DiffSinger to generate note-by-note audio (`mad_svc_spliter.py`). Accounting for timing discrepancies in the tool's output, we dynamically adjust segment durations to match the original music (`mad_svc_single.py`). Using user-provided vocal samples, we then perform voice cloning via Seed-VC (`mad_svc_coverist.py`). Finally, we reformat the musical data into the Movie Editing input specification (`mad_svc_translator.py`) to enable seamless integration with downstream agents for final video synthesis.

<a href='https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1t8ZCYsEeA/  ' target='_blank'><img src='assets/airencuoguo_cover.png' width=60%/></a>

üìù **Prompts**:
```
The song is performed by Patrick Star, focusing on the theme of ‚Äã**"the struggles of manuscript submission and dealing with overly critical reviewers"**, following the original lyrics' sentence structure while replacing specific content. It incorporates elements of reviewer nitpicking (e.g., questioning innovation, demanding redundant experiments) and expresses frustration with lines like "If only I could swap reviewers, this academic fate is too cruel" to highlight the emotional toll of peer review.
```

### 2.3 Agentic Cross-Culture Comedy
Interested in bridging cultural gaps through comedy? Transform popular English talk show segments into authentic Chinese crosstalk performances, and vice versa. Complete with cultural adaptations and localized humor that resonates with audiences of different culture backgrounds.

üöÄ **Technical Details**
- Users just need to provide the target cross-talk (comedy dialogue) audio file.
- Automatically adapts the script based on the provided target audio file.
- Automatically selects the appropriate vocal tone for voice cloning according to the emotional context of the script.

üåü **Key Features:**
- Cultural context adaptation and localization of humor
- Performance style transformation while preserving core comedic elements
- Voice generation

To produce high-quality cross-cultural comedy content, we first generate character emotion audio tracks and audience reaction effects (e.g., laughter, applause). Using LLM, we rewrite scripts line by line based on user requirements while annotating speech tones and speaker identities (`adapter.py`). We then select pre-recorded audio samples according to these tone and speaker markers, employing the open-source CosyVoice tool for voice synthesis (`synth.py`). Finally, to create corresponding video footage, we format the audio components into Movie Editing-compatible input specifications (`translator.py`), leveraging the movie editing agent pipeline to assemble the final video output.
